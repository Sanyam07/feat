#FEW-two

*FEW-two* is a feature engineering wrapper that wraps around the Shogun C++ machine learning toolkit and interfaces with scikit-learn. Its purpose is to learn new representations of raw data to improve classifier and regressor performance. The underlying methods are based on Pareto optimization and evolutionary computation to search the space of possible transformations.
